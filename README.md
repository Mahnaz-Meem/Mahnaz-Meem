### Welcome to my garden of github! ðŸ‘‹

I am Mahnaz S. Meem, a spatial analyst, geographer, and committed nature conservationist ðŸŒ± deeply immersed in the world of research and data analysis. My expertise stretches across the spectrum of physical geography, including both extensive fieldwork and detailed laboratory research. I am passionate about harnessing the power of spatial data to tackle complex questions, predict future outcomes, and foster sustainable enhancements in the quality of human life. My academic path has led me to earn a Master's degree in Landscape Ecology and Nature Conservation from the University of Greifswald, Germany, and I am currently advancing my studies with a PhD in Geography and Sustainability at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
